Troubleshooting for Clip Studio Paint

If you are struggling to import them please try the following steps:

1) Please make sure you have unzipped/extracted the files. They will
not load in if they have not been unzipped/extracted. If you don't
know how to do this, please search methods on Youtube, its quite
easy! 

2) Please make sure you are dragging in the .sut brush files, NOT
the folder itself. Try dragging a single .sut brush file in.

3) Please make sure your CSP is up to date; head over to the website
and check which version of clip studio paint is most recent. Please
update to that version.

4) If you're on an iPad, I've heard you have to load the files in one
by one via your files or a Dropbox/Google drive directory. This
may take some time. Please also double check you have unzipped the files.

5) If all of this fails, please send an email detailing your problem,
with screenshots if possible, to devinellekurtz@gmail.com. Please let me
know that you have tried the steps above. I will do my best to help as many
people as I can, but I may not be able to individually assist everyone.
Twitter is an excellent place to ask for brush related help, as is
Reddit!


If you are struggling with controlling the brushes:

1) Please watch the included demo video

2) The evergreen trees and plant stalks are intended to be used in
"upward or downward" strokes, rather than side to side. You can
of course edit these brushes to your liking.

3) Please play around with the "ink" and "blend with sub color"
settings if you're having difficulty with the color and blending.
I've set these brushes up how I would use them, but feel free to
edit anything to your liking! The demo video shows how to turn
off and on various settings.
